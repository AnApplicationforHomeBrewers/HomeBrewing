# HomeBrewing
Home brewing is an essential concept among
beer enthusiasts which requires precise
calculations and measurements. This project
aims to assist home brewers with their hobby by
helping them maintain a list of recipes and
adapt existing ones. It will also help them keep
track of ingredients. It can also give suggestions
on what to brew based on currently stored
ingredients.
